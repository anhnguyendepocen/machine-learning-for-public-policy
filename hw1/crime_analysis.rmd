# Problem 1
## Types of Crime
Across all of Chicago, the most common crime in both 2017 and 2018 was theft.
Other common crimes included battery and assault.

```{python}
crimes_2017 = df_2017.groupby('Primary Type') \
                     .size() \
                     .sort_values(ascending=False).iloc[:5]
crimes_2017

crimes_2018 = df_2018.groupby('Primary Type') \
                     .size() \
                     .sort_values(ascending=False).iloc[:5]
crimes_2018
```

These most common five crimes were the same across both years. Thefts were the
most common crime by quite a ways, as can be seen in the following graphs:

```{python, results = 'hide'}
# 2017
plt.barh(crimes_2017.index.to_numpy(), crimes_2017.values)
plt.title('Most Common Crimes (2017)')
plt.xlabel('Occurrences')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
plt.close()

# 2018
plt.barh(crimes_2018.index.to_numpy(), crimes_2018.values)
plt.title('Most Common Crimes (2018)')
plt.xlabel('Occurrences')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
plt.close()
```

## Crime Over Time
We can see from the graph below that there is a seasonal pattern to crime. Most
crimes, such as theft and battery, spike in the summer. But there are other
crimes such as "deceptive practice" that spike in the winter.

```{python, results = 'hide'}
crimes = ['THEFT', 'ASSAULT', 'BATTERY', 'CRIMINAL DAMAGE', 'DECEPTIVE PRACTICE']

crimes_2018 = df_2018[df_2018['Primary Type'].isin(crimes)]

crimes_2018['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(crimes_2018['Date'])
crimes_2018 = (crimes_2018.groupby(['Primary Type', crimes_2018['Datetime'].dt.month])
                          .size()
                          .to_frame('Count')
                          .reset_index())

for crime in crimes:
    these_crimes = crimes_2018[crimes_2018['Primary Type'] == crime]
    plt.plot(these_crimes.Datetime.values, these_crimes.Count.values)

plt.xticks(range(1, 13), ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul',
                          'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])

plt.title('Most Common Crimes Over Year (2018)')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Occurrences')
plt.legend(crimes, prop={'size': 6})

plt.show()
plt.close()
```

## Crime Locations
The community areas with the most crime (the 25th, 8th, 32nd, 28th, and 29th)
are all either downtown or on the west side.

```{python}
crimes_2017 = df_2017.groupby('Community Area') \
                     .size() \
                     .sort_values(ascending=False).iloc[:5]
crimes_2017

crimes_2018 = df_2018.groupby('Community Area') \
                     .size() \
                     .sort_values(ascending=False).iloc[:5]
crimes_2018
```
