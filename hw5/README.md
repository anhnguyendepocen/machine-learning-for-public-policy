# HW3 -- Predicting DonorsChoose.org Funding Success
**In order to generate both the analysis and policy writeups,** you must first
run `pipenv install` and then run `pipenv run doit`.

This will generate `analysis.html` and `report.pdf`.

## Project Setup
`pipenv` is used to manage Python dependencies. Install the dependencies by
running:
```
$ pipenv install
```

`doit` is used to run tasks. To run the entire pipeline and generate
predictions, simply run:
```
$ pipenv run doit
```
